# Hands-on Cryptography and Bash Scripting Fundamentals

Welcome to the hands-on cryptography and bash scripting fundamentals workshop hosted by the [Fordham ISACA Cybersecurity Club](https://www.instagram.com/fordhamcybersecurity/)!

No prior knowledge of cryptography or bash is needed. Cryptography topics include encryption/decryption, key generation, key exchange, hashing, and message authentication. Bash scripting will be taught from the ground up to implement practical scenarios using these concepts. By the end of this workshop, students will have a solid understanding of cryptography and enough experience with bash to put it on their resumes.

This workshop is based on an Applied Cryptography faculty development course created by Dr. Thaier Hayajneh (instructor) and Angelina Zaccaria (teaching assistant) of the [Fordham Center for Cybersecurity](https://www.fordham.edu/fcc/) using the National Science Foundation School For Services grant.

If you have any questions about the workshop content or need assistance with the exercises, please email Angelina Zaccaria at [azaccaria1@fordham.edu](mailto:azaccaria1@fordham.edu).

## Course Outline

**[Part 1:](part1.md) Setting Up Ubuntu**  
Students set up the virtual machine they will use throughout the rest of the workshop. There is an Ubuntu VM with the relevant packages and workshop files already installed or students can download the files on a fresh or existing VM if they would prefer.

**[Part 2:](part2.md) Symmetric Cryptography**  
Students become familiar with the command line tool in the OpenSSL toolkit. This part is a walk through of the terminal commands for encryption and decryption using symmetric algorithms. 

**[Part 3:](part3/part3.md) Asymmetric (Public Key) Cryptography**  
Students learn how to generate private and public keys for asymmetric encryption using command line OpenSSL and practice performing encryption and decryption with these keys.  

**[Part 4:](part4/part4.md) Bash Basics & Exercise 1: Key Exchange**  
Students learn bash scripting basics and apply the cryptography techniques used in parts 2 and 3 to write client and server bash scripts that perform a key exchange.

**[Part 5:](part5/part5.md) Hash Functions**  
Students learn how to perform hashing, generate message authentication codes, and generate pseudorandom bytes using command line OpenSSL.

**[Part 6:](part6/part6.md) Exercise 2: Authentication Server**  
Students apply the knowledge from previous labs to implement a message authentication scenario for secure communications.

**(optional) Part 7: Exercise 3: Algorithm Runtime Comparison**  
Students apply the knowledge from previous labs and advance their bash skills to analyze the runtimes of different encryption algorithm commands.
