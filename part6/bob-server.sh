	# 4b: receive message x and client-side hash from client - set variable contents to result of 2 listening socket commands, then print both variable contents to console
	
	
	
	# 5: perform server-side hash - pipe message into appropriate hash function, set variable contents to result of command, print variable to console
	
	
	
	# 6: compare server-side hash with client-side hash - verification is successful if they match and fails if they do not
